# Scientific-Calculator
I created a scientific calculator using Python's Tkinter library for the graphical user
interface (GUI) and the Math library for advanced mathematical functions. The calculator
includes features like basic arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, logarithms,
and more, allowing users to perform complex calculations easily. The design is user-friendly
and interactive, providing an efficient tool for solving scientific problems
